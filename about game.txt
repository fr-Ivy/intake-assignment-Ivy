fix:
- collision bullets with the tank

add:
- everytime the tank collects an item, there should be a dangerous object added to the game
- make a start screen
- make a game over screen - r to restart or wait a few seconds until it restarts


note:
- maybe increase the lives?

if there is time left (probably not) add:
- hearts in the game that the tank can collect to increase its amount of lives
