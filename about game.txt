fix:

add:
- everytime the tank collects an item, there should be a dangerous object added to the game
- make a game over screen - r to restart or wait a few seconds until it restarts
- finish the map!!!
- controls W, A, S, D

note:
- maybe increase the amount of lives?
- change the controls screen to an image with information?

if there is time left (probably not (stupid exams)) add:
- hearts in the game that the tank can collect to increase its amount of lives
