important!!!!:
- FIX THE WARNINGS


fix:


add:
- set the map in another file (map.cpp & map.h)
- change the controls screen to an image with information
- add sprite for the items (rotating coins)
- make it clear that the enemy tank is an enemy tank
- add readme.txt

note:
- Remove debug circles in release mode (using #ifdef preprocessor macros)?

if there is time left (probably not (stupid exams)) add:
- hearts in the game that the tank can collect to increase its amount of lives
- option to keep playing after player collected 8 items
- add sound effects
