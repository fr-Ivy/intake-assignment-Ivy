fix:

add:
- controls W, A, S, D
- set the map in another file (map.cpp & map.h)

note:
- maybe increase the amount of lives?
- change the controls screen to an image with information?

if there is time left (probably not (stupid exams)) add:
- hearts in the game that the tank can collect to increase its amount of lives
- option to keep playing after player collected 9 item or to go to the main menu
