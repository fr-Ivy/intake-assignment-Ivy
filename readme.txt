Welcome to my intake assignment! The game is a combination of collect and collide.

Instructions:
If you started the game, you have 3 options:
Instructions, Play or Exit.
I think the description is pretty clear...
You could take a look at 'Instructions', but they are also given here!
Once you clicked 'Play' then, Welcome!
Your goal is to collect coins with your tank.
You can move your tank with the arrow keys or WASD.
On the way to the coins, you'll see a red tank or a bullet, avoid them. You only have 3 lives!
If you collect a total of 9 coins, you win!
But if you're out of lives, you lose...
Good luck!
